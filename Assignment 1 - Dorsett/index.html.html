            Hello! My name is Alicia and welcome to my website. This website is something I am working on for a class, 
            and will be developing over time. I am a junior in college, with only three semesters left before graduation. I'm pursuing a
            major in Communications with a focus in digital media studies, but I am also pursuing three minors.
            They are (in order of completion):

            Being a full-time student, and also having a part-time work postion as well as a work-study postion, I'm pretty busy.
            With that being said, I do still have some hobbies.
            <br>
            </br>
            I like to read, and write fiction. I also really enjoy portrait photography. I've been taking photos consitently
            for around two years now. In addition to reading, and occasionally writing, I also really like film and television,
            and they've unofficially become a focus of my major.

            </br>
            I also really enjoy signing. I'm actually a memember of my campus choir as an alto.
