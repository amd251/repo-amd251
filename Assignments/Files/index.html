            Hello! My name is Alicia and welcome to my website. This website is something I am working on for a class, 
            and will be developing over the rest of this semester. I am a junior in college, with only three semesters left before graduation.
            I'm pursuing a major in Communications with a focus in digital media studies, but I am also pursuing three minors.
            They are (in order of completion):
        </p>
        
         <ul class="b">
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>History</li>
                <li>Literature</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Being a full-time student, and also having a part-time work postion as well as a work-study postion, I'm pretty busy.
            With that being said, I do still have some hobbies and interests I try to pay attention to a few time a week.
        </p>
        <p> I like to read, and write fiction. I also really enjoy portrait photography. I've been taking photos consitently
            for around two years now. 
            In addition to reading, and occasionally writing, I also really like film and television,
            and they've unofficially become a focus of my major.
            I also really enjoy signing. I'm actually a memember of my campus choir as an alto.
